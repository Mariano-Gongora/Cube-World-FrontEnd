Cube World!

A fun personal project that came about when I realized I could not build an e-commerce website for my friend's small business. I learned to make a REST API using Spring Boot, a nice looking UI using React, HTML, and CSS, and stored all data on a MySQL database.

I created mockups for the design on MS paint to have some sort of structure to follow in this completely self driven and self made project.

Added admin level business logic for item management only accessible to accounts with permissions.
